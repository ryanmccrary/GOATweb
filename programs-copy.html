    <h4>Our programs provide a clear pathway that starts with basic character qualities and builds up to real-world responsibility, leadership and job opportunities. In the context of a safe relationship, working towards goals like entrepreneurship is not only motivating for the kids we help, but has the potential to change their lives, the lives of their families, and their communities as a whole.</h4>

      <h3>Summer Adventure Programs</h3>
      <p>Our summer adventure programs provide free outdoor activies for thousands of kids each each year - mountain biking, whitewater rafting, rock climbing, hiking and backpacking - as well as indoor rock climbing. These activities provide a backdrop for gospel teaching that allows kids to escape the chaotic life circumstances they are accustomed to dealing with.</p>

      <p>We partner with over 40 organizations around the state of South Carolina - anything from group homes or after-school care centers to residential drug rehab facilities or department of juvenile justice programs. Our staff specializes in creating opportunities that suit each group's individual and specialized needs.</p>

      <p>This program fills a gap in most organization's summer programs and allow them to serve their communities more effectively.</p>

      <p>For this program, a little bit can go quite a way. Sponsorships for individual kids or groups are popular for families, businesses and churches. Find out how you can help sponsor a life-changing adventure &rarr;</p>

      <h3>Adventure Teams</h3>
      <p>Through serving thousands of at-risk students each year during the summer, we meet a number of students who connect with our staff or outdoor activities and want to learn more. Our organization has found the main motivators for these students to be <b>relationships</b> and <b>responsibility</b>.</p>
      <p>Adventure Teams are mentoring and discipleship groups that provide a framework for students to excel in school, at home, in their community and at GOAT. Adventure Teams meet together for two hours each week and students get individual attention and goal setting sessions throughout the week.</p>
      <p>Adventure Teams also provide a clear level system for students to measure their growth in success with the ultimate goal of earning more responsibility around GOAT and eventually a job as a Jr Guide. </p>
