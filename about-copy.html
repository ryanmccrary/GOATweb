    <div class="col-md-6">
      It’s estimated that XX% of kids in upstate South Carolina are under-resourced. Many times their life circumstances mean they are more likely to drop out of high school, commit a crime, join a gang, abuse drugs or be involved in teen pregnancy.
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      Our team meets kids in these circumstances and equips them with Biblical, foundational life lessons through outdoor adventure trips. Our activities create opportunities for mentorship, teaching and friendship that lead to growth and change.

      <h3>Our Financials</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of incredible people out there who give generously to make GOAT happen. We can’t begin to explain how grateful we are for the support. The money that we are entrusted with as an organization is not our own. People give us money and trust that we’ll do exactly what we say we will with it.</p>

      <p>We believe in what we do here, and we believe that the money we are given is an investment. We want it to be crystal clear where your investment is going and what the return is.</p>

      <p>In fact we care so much, that we try as hard as we can to turn it into even more money. In 2012, for every dollar donated, we were able to generate 75 cents of additional revenue from The Mountain Goat, our indoor climbing gym.</p>

      <p>All of our facility overhead - building, utilities, phones, supplies, storage and office space is funded by the gym itself. This allows us to use your money providing experiences for kids.</p>

      <p>Our 2012 financial statements will be available by the first of April, or you can view any of our previous years to the right.</p>

      <h3>Partner Agencies</h3>
      <p>Group homes, after-school care, residential treatment facilities. There is a network of organizations within Greenville and the state of South Carolina ensuring proper care and opportunity is provided for under-resourced and at-risk youth in our community.</p>

      <p>These are groups that are on the ground, taking care of kids who are at-risk often because of factors completely outside of their control. These groups provide stability and give these students a chance through schoolwork help, mentoring, feeding them meals, teaching them from the bible, loving them and showing them how to treat and respect each other.</p>

      <p>We’re honored to be able to serve many of these organizations – their kids and their leaders – through our programs. That’s the only reason we’re here. To show these kids that Jesus loves them, we love them and we want them to have a chance.</p>
