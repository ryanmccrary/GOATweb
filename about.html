            <h4>Our Financials</h4>
            <p>There are a lot of incredible people out there who give generously to make GOAT happen. We can’t begin to explain how grateful we are for the support. The money that we are entrusted with as an organization is not our own. People give us money and trust that we’ll do exactly what we say we will with it.</p>

            <p>We believe in what we do here, and we believe that the money we are given is an investment. We want it to be crystal clear where your investment is going and what the return is.</p>

            <p>In fact we care so much, that we try as hard as we can to turn it into even more money. In 2012, for every dollar donated, we were able to generate 75 cents of additional revenue from The Mountain Goat, our indoor climbing gym.</p>

            <p>All of our facility overhead - building, utilities, phones, supplies, storage and office space is funded by the gym itself. This allows us to use your money providing experiences for kids.</p>

            <p>Our 2012 financial statements will be available by the first of April, or you can view any of our previous years to the right.</p>
